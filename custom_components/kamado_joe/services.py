"""Cook-history action: local Recorder first, cloud as the archive.

Recorder already holds every reading for cooks Home Assistant was around for,
at whatever resolution it polled. Kamado Joe's cloud holds every cook ever, at
~10 s, but a completed cook is thousands of snapshots and megabytes of JSON.

So this reads locally when local data actually covers the cook, and only falls
back to the cloud when it does not — a cook that predates the integration, one
that happened while HA was down, or one Recorder has since purged.

Returned as an action response: nothing is written to entity state, and nothing
lands in the database.
